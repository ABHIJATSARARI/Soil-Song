SOIL DATA:
- pH Level: {pH_VALUE}
- Moisture Content: {MOISTURE_VALUE}%
{OPTIONAL_IMAGE_ANALYSIS}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Generate a personalized 'soil story' (300-400 words) that explains what this soil data reveals about the soil's history, current state, and potential. Make it educational but engaging, like the soil is telling its own story.

2. Create a soil health assessment with:
   - A numerical score (0-100)
   - A category label (excellent, good, fair, poor, or very poor)
   
3. Identify 0-3 potential issues with this soil based on its properties:
   - Each issue should have a description and severity (high, medium, or low)
   
4. Provide 2-4 practical recommendations for improving or maintaining this soil:
   - Each recommendation should have a clear action and additional details
   
5. Suggest 4-6 plants that would thrive in this soil based on its properties.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
{
  "story": "Your soil story text...",
  "soil_health": {
    "score": 75,
    "category": "good",
    "max_score": 100
  },
  "issues": [
    {"description": "Issue description", "severity": "medium"}
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {"action": "Actionable step", "details": "More details on the action"}
  ],
  "suitable_plants": ["plant1", "plant2", "plant3"]
}

SOIL ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- pH Interpretation:
  - Very Acidic (0-5.5): Challenging for most plants except acid-lovers like blueberries
  - Slightly Acidic (5.5-6.5): Ideal for many fruits, vegetables, and flowers
  - Neutral (6.5-7.5): Good for most garden plants and vegetables
  - Alkaline (7.5+): Better for herbs and certain ornamentals, challenging for acid-loving plants

- Moisture Interpretation:
  - Very Dry (0-20%): Drought conditions, limited for most plants except succulents
  - Dry (20-40%): Requires regular watering for most plants
  - Moderate (40-60%): Ideal moisture for most garden plants
  - Moist (60-80%): Good for moisture-loving plants but potential drainage issues
  - Wet (80-100%): Suitable only for bog plants, likely drainage problems

Consider the interaction between pH and moisture in your analysis, as they affect nutrient availability and plant health together.

This soil has likely developed over decades, gradually accumulating minerals and organic matter that create its current properties...",
